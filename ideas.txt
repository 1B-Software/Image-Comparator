How are we gonna make a for loop that augments depending on the size of images checked?
Let's think a little.......

We want to put the comparation loop inside a loop that increments every time the compared image finished comparing
itself with all the other images in the folder, then passing on to the second image to do the same, then to the third and so on
until it is done!

That's the plan
