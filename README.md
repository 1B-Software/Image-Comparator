# Image Comparator
For deleting duplicate images.

I (Robatortas) don't intend this program to be of commercial use.
This program is used for the Prolusio Interactive company, that is why the program is quite specific.

It is open source, so you can do anything you want with it!

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS
To run the program you need to download the "ImageComparator.jar" and open the Command Prompt (cmd)
by going into the windows search bar and typing cmd, the first program that appears, click on it.

Then when you're in the Command Prompt window, type the following: java -jar <drag the program to the window>

Then just hit enter and the program will run!

# Code
To see the code just look inside the repo files, you can download and modify it in any way you want!
